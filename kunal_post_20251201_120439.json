  "content": "80% of S/4HANA migrations MISS their **GRC** audit targets! 😳 We flipped the script.\n\nMassive S/4HANA projects ($3M+) often overlook built-in **compliance**. Missed **SoD**, data sovereignty issues (GDPR!), and looming EU AI Act risks threaten go-live. A 45-person team across EMEA/NA is no excuse!\n\nOur secret? Baked-in **GRC Automation** from day one. We leverage **SAP BTP** for custom controls, integrate **SAP GRC Access Control**, and build **Fiori** apps for user-friendly compliance. Hybrid Agile-Waterfall using **SAP Activate** keeps us focused.\n\nResult: We hit **95% audit readiness** on a recent S/4HANA migration, exceeding the 70% industry average, cutting post-go-live remediation by 40%. 🚀 All within the original 18-month timeline.\n\nWhat's your biggest challenge embedding Data Sovereignty principles into your S/4HANA migration? 🤔\n\n#S4HANA #SAP #GRC #Compliance #DataGovernance #Audit #SAPActivate #SAPGRC #DataSovereignty #EUAIAct",
