  "content": "80% of S/4HANA migrations miss their **GRC** audit targets 🤯. A hard lesson learned on a recent $3.8M global rollout. Why? Data chaos & poorly defined **SoD** rules. Ignoring **Data Sovereignty** for 10,000+ users across EMEA = compliance nightmares. \n\nOur fix? Building automated GRC controls using **SAP BTP** & **GRC Access Control**, powered by a 50-person global team using a hybrid Agile-Waterfall **SAP Activate** approach. Proactive risk assessments & real-time compliance monitoring are key. \n\nResult: We hit 95% audit readiness in 6 months, slashing potential penalties by 40% and saving $750K in manual audit efforts.  A completely reimagined, Fiori-based **GRC** experience.\n\nHow are you baking *compliance-by-design* into your S/4HANA journey?\n\n#S4HANA #GRC #SAP #Compliance #DataSovereignty #Audit #RiskManagement #SAPActivate #Tech #Innovation",
