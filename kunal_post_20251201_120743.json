  "content": "80% of S/4HANA migrations fail their initial **GRC** audit. Ouch! \n\nThe challenge? Global rollouts across 15 countries with 5,000+ users struggling to maintain **Data Sovereignty** and strict **SoD** rules. Result: $3M+ programs delayed, GDPR fines looming.\n\nOur solution? We built a pre-migration **GRC Automation** framework on **SAP BTP**, integrating **SAP GRC Access Control** and **Fiori** apps. A 45-person team using Agile-Waterfall (SAP Activate inspired) made it happen. \n\nResult? We achieved 95% audit readiness *before* go-live, slashed remediation efforts by 40%, and delivered the project 2 months ahead of schedule. 🚀\n\nWhat's your biggest fear when it comes to S/4HANA compliance? #S4HANA #GRC #SAP #Compliance #DataSovereignty #SoD #Audit #SAPActivate #DigitalTransformation #EUAIAct",
